WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net icon_control0<13> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         818 out of  55,296    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          817
    Number used as Latches:               1
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,436 out of  55,296    2%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,021 out of  27,648    3%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,021 out of   1,021 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,021   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,627 out of  55,296    2%
    Number used as logic:             1,357
    Number used as a route-thru:        191
    Number used as Shift registers:      79

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
