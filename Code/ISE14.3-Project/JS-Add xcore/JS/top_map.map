WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net icon_control0<13> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       2,423 out of  55,296    4%
    Number used as Flip Flops:        2,422
    Number used as Latches:               1
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,513 out of  55,296    4%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,965 out of  27,648    7%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,965 out of   1,965 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,965   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,743 out of  55,296    4%
    Number used as logic:             2,434
    Number used as a route-thru:        230
    Number used as Shift registers:      79

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
