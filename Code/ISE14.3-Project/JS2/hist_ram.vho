-- The following code must appear in the VHDL architecture header:

------------- Begin Cut here for COMPONENT Declaration ------ COMP_TAG
component hist_ram

	clk: IN std_logic;
	din: IN std_logic_VECTOR(31 downto 0);

-- FPGA Express Black Box declaration

-- Synplicity black box declaration
attribute syn_black_box : boolean;
attribute syn_black_box of hist_ram: component is true;

-- COMP_TAG_END ------ End COMPONENT Declaration ------------

-- The following code must appear in the VHDL architecture
-- body. Substitute your own instance name and net names.

------------- Begin Cut here for INSTANTIATION Template ----- INST_TAG

-- You must compile the wrapper file hist_ram.vhd when simulating

-- reference the XilinxCoreLib VHDL simulation library. For detailed
-- instructions, please refer to the "CORE Generator Help".
